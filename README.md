# Comparison-of-Blind-Source-Separation-techniques
Compare AIRES BSS with ILRMA and AuxIVA


This sample software applies Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithms to simulated convolutive mixtures in order to compare separation performance.

* The main file to run comparison:

main_bss_separation.m

The main executable file separates convolutive mixture using our proposed Time Domain Stereo Audio Source Separation technique (AIRES), frequency domain BSS ILRMA[1,2] and AuxIVA[2]. Ater separation main_bss_separation.m prints out Signal-to-Distortion Ratio and computation time for all 3 BSS (SIR and SAR also can be printed, since whey are calculated as well).

* How to change convolutive mixtures:

- simply uncomment in the beginning of the file desired line with FileName "fname". 

Pay attention - all BSS work only with audio signals of 16kHz sampling rate.
